This is a project that I'm working on to create code and written content for teaching kids how to use PixiJS to create a basic HTML game.

I'm building up markdown educational content alongside the code to make it easier for kids to follow along and understand game development concepts. I'll ask for either code changes to make to the html / js / css files or for markdown content that I can add to the project.

This project is intended to be fun, easy to follow and just teach the basics. As such we want to focus on keeping the code comprehensible and avoiding unnecessary complexity. Teach and organize just enough for the students to learn and avoid code that might improve performance for a full game, but that would make things easier to learn. When I ask for change look to scope just small changes for what I'm asking, don't rewrite more of the file in other areas. 

When changing the code be careful to use PixiJS 8.0 concepts and classes. PixiJS 7.0 is a different API, and still fairly popular so make sure to use 8.0 classes and concepts. Also note, we are running this as a simple HTML webpage and we are not using a building / bundler so we need to use the global PIXI object.

The documentation on PixiJS 8.0 API can be found at https://pixijs.download/release/docs/index.html and is a great resource for understanding the new features and changes.
